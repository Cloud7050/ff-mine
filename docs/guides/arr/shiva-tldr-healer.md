This fight involves the boss equipping weapons (Blade/Staff/Bow), which determine the attacks she will use.

Your default state should be to stack behind the boss with everyone, to aid with mechanics.

## Phase 1

The boss will equip Blade and Staff once each. Between them, she will use Icicle Impact.

- Icicle Impact: 8 circles that inflict vuln stacks. Wait for all circles to appear before dodging, as there will only be 1 safe spot left\

Blade:

- Icebrand: Group soak cleave
- Whiteout: Donut AoE

After equipping, the boss immediately uses Icebrand.

Staff:

- Hailstorm: AoE markers on 4 targets

While the boss is equipping, everyone should spread for Hailstorm. The boss casts it immediately after equipping.

## Phase 2

The boss spawns 4 Ice Soldier adds, then equips Blade. Remember to stay stacked for Icebrand.

## Phase 3

Touching the edge of the arena now jails you in an Ice Boulder.

Icicle Impact now has 2 new patterns instead. The boss's rotation is Icicle Impact (Double) → Staff → Icicle Impact (Loop) → Bow. This then repeats, except that Staff will sometimes be Blade.

- Icicle Impact (Double): 4 circles, then another 5 circles including the centre
- Icicle Impact (Loop): Circles that cover the centre, then go clockwise/counter-clockwise
- Permafrost: Makes the floor slippery

Blade:

Icebrand happens at the second part of Icicle Impact (Double). Stay stacked for the MT to do the group soak before you dodge.

Bow:

- Glass Dance: 270° cleave that oneshots squishies. Safe area is behind the boss
- Avalanche: Marks a target with a blue marker, then does a line AoE with massive knockback

After every Icicle Impact (Loop), everyone must quickly get behind the boss. She will equip Bow, then immediately use Glass Dance!

The MT should then move the boss onto C, facing her outwards. Stack behind her and wait for the Avalanche marker to appear. The target should stand behind her while everyone else dodges.
