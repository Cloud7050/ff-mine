This fight involves the boss equipping weapons (Blade/Staff/Bow), which determine the attacks she will use.

Your default state should be to stack behind the boss with everyone, to aid with mechanics.

## Phase 1

The boss will use Blade and Staff once each. Between them, she will use Icicle Impact.

- Icicle Impact: 8 circles that inflict vuln stacks. Wait for all circles to appear before dodging, as there will only be 1 safe spot left\

Blade:

- Icebrand: Group soak cleave
- Whiteout: Donut AoE

After equipping, the boss immediately turns to MT and uses Icebrand.

Staff:

- Hailstorm: AoE markers on 4 targets

While the boss is equipping, everyone should spread for Hailstorm. The boss casts it immediately after equipping.
