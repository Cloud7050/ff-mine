## What

**Phase 1**\
At the start of the fight, there are 3 Scourge of Meracydia adds alongside the boss (Twintania).

- Plummet: Cleave
- Death Sentence: Tankbuster

Scourge of Meracydia:

- Liquid Hell: Leaves an orange circle on the ground that inflicts an unstackable DoT (Burns) while standing in it. Standing in multiple circles does not increase damage taken

Neurolink:\
The boss is restrained by 3 Neurolink rings. 1 breaks and drops under her as a persistent black circle at the end of phases 1, 2 and 4.

Standing in it inflicts the Neurolink debuff. This halves your damage dealt and healing received, and makes you move slightly slower. However, it lets you survive Aetheric Profusion & Hatch in later phases.

**Phase 2**

- Death Sentence: Now also inflicts 15s of Infirmity, reducing healing from spells (but not skills/abilities)
- Fireball: Marks a target with a red marker for 5s, then hits them with a group soak AoE. At least 4 people are needed for the stack to survive. Each person hit gives the boss a stack of Waxen Flesh, visualised with an orange tether
  - Waxen Flesh: Each stack shortens the time before Conflagration explodes
- Firestorm: Marks a target with a blue marker for 3s, then traps them and everyone nearby in a Conflagration circle slightly smaller than the boss's hitbox. Going in causes you to also be trapped. Trapped people suffer a weaker Burns DoT, but are otherwise immune to damage. Conflagration must be killed quickly or it will explode, killing everyone trapped inside

## When

**Phase 1**\
7s: Plummet (repeats every 13s)\
18s: Death Sentence (repeats every 35s)

**Phase 2** at <85% HP\
8s: Fireball marker (repeats every 25s)\
28s: Firestorm marker (repeats every 35s)

## How

**Phase 1**

- A healer should be assigned to each tank for when both are taking damage. I recommend the shield healer pocket the MT
  - Healers need to keep the MT topped up, as attacks can crit. Otherwise, the MT will likely die suddenly
- The MT should ignore the adds and grab the boss, positioning her on A and facing her away. Do this quickly before she uses Plummet to not cleave the party
  - We aim to drop her first Neurolink on A
- The OT should grab the adds and move them away from the boss. Adds should be killed first
- The MT must mit tankbusters. Death Sentence is usually followed by a Plummet, which is a lethal combo
- As you near phase 2's breakpoint, 4 dps should stack to the bottom right of the boss to soak the first Fireball

**Phase 2**

Resolving Fireball:

- We aim to have no more than 4 people soak Fireball to not make Conflagration harder
  - We prioritise dps getting hit as they have more health than healers, and healers will get interrupted by the damage. The OT will be busy with timely tank swaps and pointing cleaves away
- As above, 4 dps should stack to the bottom right of the boss. There will sometimes be less dps stacked due to Conflagration or deaths
- 1 dps should be assigned the task of leaving the stack if there are too many people. The healers should be assigned a priority for who joins the stack first if there are too few people
  - To keep things simple, these 3 people should only adjust *after* the Fireball marker appears. We don't need to keep adjusting in between Fireballs, and we don't want edge cases like the first healer joining the stack, then the second healer getting marked
- When the Fireball marker appears, if Conflagration is up, the target should just walk in and get trapped too. This skips Fireball entirely
- Otherwise, the marked target must stay stacked/join the stack. Any dps who aren't stacked properly should get in position too. Then, adjust based on how many are now stacked.\
  e.g. if 4 dps are stacked (dps marked), don't move.\
  e.g. if 4 dps and 1 marked healer are stacked, the assigned dps should leave.\
  e.g. if 3 dps are stacked (dps marked), the first healer should join.\
  e.g. if 2 dps are stacked (dps marked), both healers should join
- Afterwards, reset your positioning and repeat. i.e. all dps should stack and healers should unstack

<br />

- After the first Fireball, the MT should move the boss onto B. We aim to drop her second Neurolink on B
- The MT should face the boss towards C while the OT stands to the left of the boss\
  TODO infographic goes here
  - This allows clean tank swaps - neither tank has to move and Plummet won't cleave both tanks right after the swap. This is similar to how we handle Flare Breaths in T13. Meanwhile, dps can stay stacked in the same spot and hit positionals regardless of who's tanking

## Other Tips

Phase 1:

- You can pre-pull mage LB
- The initial pull is a little tricky. Both tanks should run in together with stance on. The MT should only use single target attacks on the boss, while the OT AoEs everything. This way, each tank will be able to maintain aggro on their respective targets
- The MT can turn the boss if she gets covered by Liquid Hells, to help melees hit positionals

Phase 2:

- If you are struggling with Conflagration killing people, such as due to too many getting hit by Fireball, try to save your burst for it

<br />

- If you are new to MINE content like this, note that the philosophy for healers is very different. Healers will spend a lot of time casting MP-efficient GCD heals. Your priority is to keep everyone alive as opposed to squeezing in damage
- Pets no longer have their own healthbars and don't count for mechanics, so certain old strats you may encounter no longer work the same
- It's not feasible to run this with 1 tank MINE, but damage shouldn't be a problem
