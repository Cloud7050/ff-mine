Throughout the fight, the boss will disappear and use 1-2 Spinning Dives, then reappear with Body Slam. These are telegraphed by water jets:\

- Spinning Dive: Does high damage with a vuln stack, and can knock you off the arena
- Body Slam: Tilts the arena, which can make you slide off. Dodge to the opposite end of the arena

## Phase 1

The boss has a head that reflects ranged physical damage, and a tail that reflects magic damage. Melees and mdps should attack the head while pdps should attack the tail.

2 Wavespine Sahagin will spawn. Immediately stop attacking the boss and kill Wavespines instead, or you will spawn the next add early. Wavespines need to be killed quickly or they will start to mess up the fight.

Then, a Wavetooth Sahagin will spawn. Similarly, immediately switch to killing it. It must be burnt asap as it has 2 hysteria attacks. OT should stun it the moment it drops below 80% HP, and melees should continue to chain stun it. At <70% HP, it will immediately start casting Dreadstorm, during which it is immune to stun.

Later, 4 Gyre Spumes will spawn (shown above). These should be focused one by one so that you have enough charge for the Elemental Converter. Keep 1 Gyre alive until the boss disappears to start 2 dives, then kill it.

The boss will reappear briefly, then disappear again for 1 vertical dive. Press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 2

Another 2 Wavespines will spawn.

Then, another 4 Gyres will spawn, followed by 4 Wave Spumes (shown above). Don't bother trying to kill the Wave Spumes, let OT kite them away. They will eventually explode and deal proximity-based damage.

After the Wave Spumes have exploded, the boss will again disappear for 1 vertical dive. Similarly, press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 3

Another Wavetooth will spawn. Remember to chain stun and burn it asap. If too many are dead to kill it quickly, dps LB if you really must. It can easily hysteria everyone off the arena.
