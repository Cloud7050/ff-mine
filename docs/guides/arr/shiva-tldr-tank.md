This fight involves the boss equipping weapons (Blade/Staff/Bow), which determine the attacks she will use.

<img class="border" src="images/shiva-waymarks.png" width="250" />\
Set waymarks as shown. The boss should be on A (mid), MT on B. OT's default state should be to stack behind the boss with everyone else, to aid with mechanics.

## Phase 1

The boss will use Blade and Staff once each. Between them, she will use Icicle Impact.

- Icicle Impact: 8 circles that inflict vuln stacks. Wait for all circles to appear before dodging, as there will only be 1 safe spot left\
  <img class="border" src="images/shiva-icicle-impact-staggered.png" width="500" />

Blade:

- Attack: Inflicts Blunt Resistance Down stacks (makes tank weaker to Staff)
- Icebrand: Group soak cleave
- Heavenly Strike: Raidwide that knocks both tanks back a fair distance
- Glacial Bash: Dodgeable cleave that stuns for 4s

While the boss is equipping, MT should run through her to stack with the party. After equipping, the boss immediately turns to MT and uses Icebrand.

MT then waits to dodge Glacial Bash by running through the boss again.

Staff:

- Attack: Inflicts Slashing Resistance Down stacks (makes tank weaker to Blade)
- Hailstorm: AoE markers on 4 targets

While the boss is equipping, everyone should spread for Hailstorm. The boss casts it immediately after equipping. MT then repositions boss back on A.








**Phase 2**

- Remember that there will be Icebrand shortly after the adds spawn! Everyone should stay stacked, while OT grabs all adds and returns to the stack
- Also don't forget Glacial Bash
- When the boss disappears, MT should stand on A so she reappears there
- Phase 2 only has a single Blade equip. Whoever is MT in this phase will continue to tank subsequent Blade equips, while the OT tanks Staff equips in phase 3

**Phase 3**

- Phase 3 always starts with a Staff equip. The MT would have built up a lot of Blunt stacks during phase 2. A tank swap at the start is required
- Each weapon now lasts ~45s instead of being triggered by breakpoints. Continue to tank swap based on her weapon
- Permafrost is generally used towards the end of each weapon rotation, but not always. The boss sometimes uses it with no weapon, or early in the weapon rotation. She will not use it during the first Staff equip
  - Try to stay still once you are in position and not fidget
  - When the floor looks like a cyclone, that's your cue to stop moving immediately. Otherwise, you can easily slip into the edge of the arena and get jailed

Blade:

- Icebrand happens at the start of the second part of Icicle Impact (Double). Stay stacked for MT to do the group soak before you dodge
- After Heavenly Strike, MT repositions boss back on A

Staff:

- Hailstorm now happens alongside the second part of Icicle Impact (Double). It's now even more important to start spreading early
  - If you reach a safe spot early, prefer running to a corner near the edge of the arena. This way, if you have a Hailstorm marker, you won't clip people arriving later. Similarly, you won't get clipped by someone with a Hailstorm marker arriving later

Bow:

- Remember that there will be Glass Dance shortly after every Icicle Impact (Loop)! Everyone must quickly get behind the boss to avoid oneshot. Don't forget sprint
  - The MT will also be dodging Icicle Impact. There is very little time to turn the boss before she starts equipping Bow and her direction is locked, so be wary as she may be facing weird
- After Glass Dance, MT repositions boss onto C, facing her outwards. Stack behind her and wait for the Avalanche marker to appear
  - When the marker appears, the target should stand behind her while everyone else dodges. This makes the line AoE only hit the target, who will also have enough space to not get knocked into the edge
- After Avalanche, MT repositions boss back on A










**Phase 2**\
The boss returns to mid and spawns 4 Ice Soldier adds.

- Diamond Dust: The boss disappears and does a raidwide. If any adds are still alive, it's a wipe

**Phase 3**\
The boss reappears atop the MT. Icicle Impact now has 2 new patterns instead.

- Icicle Impact (Double): Covers the ground with 4 circle AoEs. After they go off, covers the ground with another 5 circle AoEs including the centre
- Icicle Impact (Loop): Sequentially covers the ground with circle AoEs, first covering the centre, then going in a clockwise/counter-clockwise loop
- Permafrost: Makes the floor slippery, forcing you to slip in a long straight line with each step. Also inflicts an uncleansable 50s DoT (Frostbite). Used at irregular intervals

Bow:\
After equipping, the boss immediately uses Glass Dance. She will not turn; she stays in the same direction she was in while equipping!

- Glass Dance: 270Â° cleave that oneshots squishies. Safe area is behind her
- Avalanche: Marks a target with a blue marker, then does a line AoE with massive knockback. Used 20s after equipping

Ice Boulder:\
Touching the edge of the arena now jails you in an Ice Boulder. While jailed, you have a DoT (Deep Freeze) that also makes you unable to act. Others can kill it to free you
