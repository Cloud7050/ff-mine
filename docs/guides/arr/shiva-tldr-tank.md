This fight involves the boss equipping weapons (Blade/Staff/Bow), which determine the attacks she will use.

<img class="border" src="images/shiva-waymarks.png" width="250" />\
Set waymarks as shown. The boss should be on A (mid), and the MT on B. The OT's default state should be to stack behind the boss with everyone else, to aid with mechanics.

## Phase 1

The boss will equip Blade and Staff once each. Between them, she will use Icicle Impact.

- Icicle Impact: 8 circles that inflict vuln stacks. Wait for all circles to appear before dodging, as there will only be 1 safe spot left\
  <img class="border" src="images/shiva-icicle-impact-staggered.png" width="500" />

Blade:

- Attack: Inflicts Blunt Resistance Down stacks (makes tank weaker to Staff)
- Icebrand: Group soak cleave
- Heavenly Strike: Raidwide that knocks both tanks back a fair distance
- Glacier Bash: Dodgeable cleave that stuns for 4s

While the boss is equipping, the MT should run through her to stack with the party. After equipping, the boss immediately uses Icebrand.

The MT then goes back to B, and waits to dodge Glacier Bash by running through the boss again.

Staff:

- Attack: Inflicts Slashing Resistance Down stacks (makes tank weaker to Blade)
- Hailstorm: AoE markers on 4 targets

While the boss is equipping, everyone should spread for Hailstorm. The boss casts it immediately after equipping. The MT should then reposition the boss back on A.

## Phase 2

The boss spawns 4 Ice Soldier adds, then equips Blade. While the OT grabs adds and returns to the stack, the MT should handle Icebrand and Glacier Bash.

## Phase 3

Touching the edge of the arena now jails you in an Ice Boulder.

Icicle Impact now has 2 new patterns instead. The boss's rotation is Icicle Impact (Double) → Staff → Icicle Impact (Loop) → Bow. This then repeats, except that Staff will sometimes be Blade.

- Icicle Impact (Double): 4 circles, then another 5 circles including the centre
- Icicle Impact (Loop): Circles that cover the centre, then go clockwise/counter-clockwise
- Permafrost: Makes the floor slippery

A tank swap at the start is required. Continue to swap based on her weapon. Remember to handle her Staff/Blade attacks like in phase 1.

Blade:

Icebrand happens at the second part of Icicle Impact (Double). The OT should stay stacked for the MT to do the group soak before dodging.

Bow:

- Glass Dance: 270° cleave that oneshots squishies. Safe area is behind the boss
- Avalanche: Marks a target with a blue marker, then does a line AoE with massive knockback

After every Icicle Impact (Loop), everyone must quickly get behind the boss. She will equip Bow, then immediately use Glass Dance!

The MT should then move the boss onto C, facing her outwards. The OT should stack behind her and wait for the Avalanche marker to appear. The target should stand behind her while everyone else dodges.

After Avalanche, the MT should reposition the boss back on A.
