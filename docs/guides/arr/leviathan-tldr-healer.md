Throughout the fight, the boss will disappear and use 1-2 Spinning Dives, then reappear with Body Slam. These are telegraphed by water jets:\

- Spinning Dive: Does high damage with a vuln stack, and can knock you off the arena
- Body Slam: Tilts the arena, which can make you slide off. Dodge to the opposite end of the arena

## Phase 1

The boss has a head that reflects ranged physical damage, and a tail that reflects magic damage. Healers should attack the head.

- Briny Veil: Whenever you directly heal the OT, you get a debuff stack which reduces your action range. You need to let them expire when the stacks get too high
- Waterspout: AoEs that target both healers. Healers should stay apart

2 Wavespine Sahagin will spawn.

Then, a Wavetooth Sahagin will spawn. It must be burnt asap as it has 2 hysteria attacks.

Later, 4 Gyre Spumes will spawn. Keep 1 Gyre alive until the boss disappears to start 2 dives, then kill it.

The boss will reappear briefly, then disappear again for 1 vertical dive. Press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 2

Another 2 Wavespines will spawn.

Then, another 4 Gyres will spawn, followed by 4 Wave Spumes (shown above). Don't bother trying to kill the Wave Spumes, let OT kite them away. They will eventually explode and deal proximity-based damage.

After the Wave Spumes have exploded, the boss will again disappear for 1 vertical dive. Similarly, press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 3

Another Wavetooth will spawn. Remember to stun and burn it asap. It can easily hysteria everyone off the arena.
