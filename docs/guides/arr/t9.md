This is a partial guide which only covers the last, hardest phase.

Sections:

- [**What**](#what) the mechanics are
- [**When**](#when) they happen
- [**How**](#how) to do them (the strat)
- [Other tips](#other-tips)

## What

- Raven Dive: The boss dives onto a target, dealing light AoE damage
- Lunar Dynamo (aka donut): Donut AoE that lifesteals
- Iron Chariot: Large AoE with knockback
- Thermionic Beam: Marks a target with a red marker, then hits them with a group soak AoE
- Meteor Stream: Marks 4 targets with a white marker, then hits each of them with an AoE. Used twice in a row (may get marked both times)
- Dalamud Dive: The boss reappears atop the MT, dealing high AoE damage

**Phase 4**

- Bahamut's Claw: Tankbuster. Now used 5 times in a row
- Super Nova (aka blackhole): Spawns a blackhole under a target, which repeatedly pulls in everyone in a small AoE, dealing damage and inflicting 5s of heavy. Now used 3 times in a row
- Bahamut's Favor: The boss gains a buff stack. 3 dragons spawn outside the arena

Dragons:\
These adds cannot be attacked, and do ice/fire/thunder mechanics. Towards the end of the rotation, they instead do divebombs before disappearing. There are 3 possible spawn patterns, which determine where their dives start from.

- Iceball: Cycles through a target every 3s, inflicting 85s of Icebitten
- Fireball: Marks a target with an orange tether, then hits them with a small AoE, inflicting 45s of Firescorched. Used every 12s
  - Icebitten/Firescorched cancel each other out, but are lethal if their target already has the same debuff
- Chain Lightning: Inflicts 5s of Thunderstruck on a target. Used after each Fireball tether
  - Thunderstruck: On expiry, anyone near them takes high damage and suffers 30s of uncleansable paralysis
- Cauterize (aka divebomb): Marks a target with a green marker. When it disappears, remembers that location. 1-2 dragons then simultaneously dive at it. Each does a line AoE, dealing high damage with massive knockback
  - This is used twice in succession. The first green marker always has 2 dragons dive it; the second green marker has the 1 remaining dragon dive it
  - By starting north and counting the dragons clockwise, we can tell regardless of pattern that the first 2 dragons to be counted will dive first. However, there's a much easier way to resolve divebombs (explained in [How](#how))

## How

- <img class="border" src="images/t9-waymarks.png" height="300" />\
  Waymarks A/1 form a red line pointing north, useful for orientation when identifying divebomb pattern (explained below). (They're used to bait Dive and stack for Beam respectively in phase 1)

**Phase 4**

- At the start of each rotation (when the boss casts Favor), everyone should stack tightly at A with the MT
  - There are no more cleaves in this phase. Prioritise clear positioning and resolving mechanics
- Handle the odd sets of Claws by tank swapping in the middle of the Claw hits. Invuln the even sets of Claws. Odd Claws happen at the start of the rotation, which is significantly less chaotic than for even Claws
  - The OT should mit during the Favor castbar, and provoke when they see the 1st Claw hit, so each tank only takes 2-3 hits

Handling ice/fire:

- We alternate when the stack gets hit by Fireballs to keep Icebitten/Firescorched in check
- There are 2 callouts - "fire out" and "fire in". Fire out means the fire tether should temporarily leave the stack so Fireball doesn't hit the stack; fire in means the fire tether should stay stacked so Fireball hits the stack
- Fire out on odd Fireballs, and fire in on even Fireballs (i.e. fire out → in → out → in for every rotation). This lines up nicely with the other mechanics
- During fire in, anyone already with Firescorched *must* adjust by leaving the stack, or it will kill them
  - The fire tether who did fire out will likely find they still have Firescorched during the subsequent fire in
  - This can also occur due to low deaths and doing fire in correctly, or doing fire out wrongly
- During fire out, anyone with Icebitten can play it safe by joining the fire tether when they leave the stack, to cancel out their Icebitten early
  - This can occur due to it being early in the rotation, too many deaths, or doing fire in wrongly

<br />

- For Fireball 1 (fire out), the fire tether should run behind the boss, but not too far, in case the boss picks them for Raven Dive, and because they need to rejoin the stack for donut
- Remember to check for Thunderstruck shortly after *every* Fireball tether. The callout for this is "thunder out". Thunder must similarly temporarily leave the stack to not hit anyone. Hitting the stack with Lightning is almost certainly a wipe
- After Fireball 1, it is thunder's turn to run behind the boss, but again not too far due to donut
  - Everyone else should restack back *in front* of the boss once she uses Raven Dive, to give thunder enough space. She will likely have dived onto the stack, so don't stay in her hitbox or Lightning will clip you
- After Fireball 2, everyone should spread, so we naturally resolve Lightning 2, Fireball 3 (fire out), and Lightning 3
  - Avoid A so we don't get blackholes near it. We will reuse it as our stack spot
- When you see the 2nd blackhole, immediately sprint to stack at A for Beam. Stay stacked for Fireball 4 (fire in)

Checking divebomb pattern:

- We aim to bait divebombs to the edges of the arena so no one gets hit. There are 3 coloured waymark pairs corresponding to each possible dragon pattern to make baiting easier
- <img class="border" src="images/infographics/t9-divebombs.png" width="700" />\
  If there's a dragon north, it's pattern 2 - use yellow waymarks 2 then B.\
  Else, if there's a dragon northwest, it's pattern 3 - use blue waymarks 3 then C.\
  Otherwise it's pattern 4 - use purple waymarks 4 then D
- Before divebombs start, there's plenty of time to check. You may want to assign a dps to call out the correct waymarks for each rotation in advance

Handling divebombs:

- Bait the 1st divebombs to the number waymark, then bait the 2nd divebomb to the letter waymark
  - If you get a green marker, sprint to the correct waymark and wait for it to disappear, then run back
- After even Claws, everyone should go near the 1st waymark. Whoever gets the green marker should stand in it, then everyone else can similarly go near the 2nd waymark
- For odd rotation:
  - Due to Meteor Streams, stay spread when going near the 2nd waymark, and spread some more after 2nd green marker appears
  - Avoid the MT due to Dalamud Dive
- For even rotation:
  - After Raven Dive, immediately run near the boss due to donut. Healers can rescue whoever got the 2nd green marker after it disappears so they don't get hit by donut on the way back

## Other Tips

- If you damage is good such that you're reaching phase 4 during 2nd Heavensfall, consider holding damage till after it finishes (but before 2nd add spawns) to make the start of phase 4 less chaotic
- Donut snapshots like any other attack, so thunder doesn't have to wait for the animation. Thunder can run further out once the castbar ends if space is really needed, but the timing is tight
- The green markers work differently from T5 and T13's divebombs
