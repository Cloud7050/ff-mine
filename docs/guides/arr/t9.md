This is a partial guide which only covers the last, hardest phase. It assumes knowledge of the previous phases, so repeated mechanics that already occurred before phase 4 are described in less detail.

**Phase 4**
Boss hits 47% health (around after second pillar). She casts Bahamut's Favour (gives her a buff stack and spawns the 3 adds). We all tight stack at mid (boss doesn't cleave in second half).

*Attack Order:*
• Tankbuster

• Fire out (fire tether goes behind the boss, so in case she dives you she's not too far)
• Fire explodes and boss dives onto someone. Thunder debuff applied which explodes in 5s (everyone should move back in front of the boss after she dives, to give room for thunder. Thunder debuff goes behind the boss, because of donut)
• Thunder explodes and donut

• Fire in (fire tether stay stacked. If you already have fire debuff, run away. Can happen for example if you were the fire out)
• Fire explodes and thunder applied (everyone is now free to spread!)
• Iron Chariot (large knockback AoE). Stay spread (we naturally resolve the thunder, as well as the next fire out and next thunder)

• 3 blackholes (when you see second blackhole, immediately sprint to stack at mid)
• Thermionic Beam (red spiky stack marker)
• Tankbuster

• Fire in (fire debuff: run away)
• Thunder (run away)

• Divebombs
• Repeat phase

Fire happens every 12s. Ice cycles through one person every 3s. They cancel each other out but kill you at 2 stacks.
If no one dies and we splash fire correctly, we'll have too much fire debuff. Fire debuffs will need to leave the fire in.
On the other hand, too many deaths or fire not splashing enough people means we'll have too much ice. You can adjust by joining the fire out if you have ice debuff

**Identifying Divebomb Pattern**

If there is an add at N, it is pattern 2 (yellow waymarks 2 then B).
Else, if there is an add at NW, it is pattern 3 (blue waymarks 3 then C).
Else it is pattern 4 (purple waymarks 4 then D)

**Divebombs**

2 green markers happen one after the other. 2 adds dive the first marker, then the last add dives the second marker. The idea is to bait them to the edge of the arena so no one gets hit.

Based on the pattern of the adds, we know which waymarks to follow. First divebomb is baited to the number, and the second to the letter. If you get a green marker, go to the correct waymark and wait for it to disappear, then run back.

We start by all going near the first waymark. Whoever gets the green marker can stand in it, the rest of us can similarly go near the second waymark. After that, we spread around mid (avoid the edges where divebombs are).

During the first wave of divebombs, the boss will disappear and do sets of blue marker AoEs like in phase 1, so stay spread. Similarly avoid MT, as boss will dive back AoE them. After this wave, phase 4 repeats (fire out etc).

After phase 4 repeats, for the second wave of divebombs, the boss will use Iron Chariot followed by donut. So we do the usual "go near first waymark" "go near second waymark", but stack immediately after Iron Chariot for donut. Consider healer rescue on whoever got the second marker so they don't get hit by donut

**Divebomb Order**

1st divebomb wave:
• All go near first waymark
• Person with first green marker goes to waymark. Run back once mark disappears
• All *spread* near second waymark
• Second green marker, same thing
• Stay spread around mid for blue marker AoEs
• Avoid MT, boss will AoE dive back

2nd divebomb wave:
• All go near first waymark
• First green marker
• Boss does Iron Chariot AoE
• All go near second waymark
• Second green marker
• Boss dives someone and does donut. All go near boss immediately
