This is a partial guide which only covers the last, hardest phase.

Sections:

- [**What**](#what) the mechanics are
- [**When**](#when) they happen
- [**How**](#how) to do them (the strat)
- [Other tips](#other-tips)

## What

- Raven Dive: The boss dives onto a target, dealing light AoE damage
- Lunar Dynamo: Donut AoE that lifesteals
- Iron Chariot: Large AoE with knockback
- Thermionic Beam: Marks a target with a red marker, then hits them with a group soak AoE
- Meteor Stream: Marks 4 targets with a white marker, then hits each of them with an AoE. Used twice in a row (may get marked both times)
- Dalamud Dive: The boss reappears atop the MT, dealing high AoE damage

**Phase 4**

- Bahamut's Claw: Tankbuster. Now used 5 times in a row
- Super Nova: Spawns a blackhole under a target, which repeatedly pulls in everyone in a small AoE, dealing damage and inflicting 5s of heavy. Now used 3 times in a row
- Bahamut's Favor: The boss gains a buff stack. 3 dragons spawn outside the arena

**Dragons**
These adds cannot be attacked, and do ice/fire/thunder mechanics. At the end of the rotation, they do divebombs before disappearing. There are 3 possible spawn patterns, which determine where their dives start from.

- Iceball: Cycles through a target every 3s, inflicting Icebitten
- Fireball: Marks a target with an orange tether, then hits them with a small AoE, inflicting Firescorched. Used every 12s
  - Icebitten/Firescorched cancel each other out, but are lethal if their target already has the same debuff
- Chain Lightning: Inflicts 5s of Thunderstruck on a target. Used after each Fireball tether
  - Thunderstruck: On expiry, anyone near them takes high damage and suffers 30s of uncleansable paralysis
- Cauterize (aka divebombs): Marks a target with a green marker. When it disappears, remembers that location. 1-2 dragons then simultaneously dive at it. Each does a line AoE, dealing high damage with massive knockback
  - This is used twice in succession. The first green marker always has 2 dragons dive it; the second green marker has the 1 remaining dragon dive it
  - By starting north and counting the dragons clockwise, we can tell regardless of pattern that the first 2 dragons to be counted will dive first. However, there's a much easier way to resolve divebombs (explained in [How](#how))

**Phase 4**

Handling ice/fire:

- We alternate when we get hit by Fireballs to keep Icebitten/Firescorched cancelled out
- There are 2 callouts - "fire out" and "fire in". Fire out means the fire tether should leave the stack and get hit by Fireball alone. Fire in means the fire tether should stay stacked so Fireball hits the stack
- Each rotation has 4 fire tethers. Starting from fire tether 1, we do fire out → in → out → in, which lines up nicely with the other mechanics

<br />

- At the start of each rotation (when the boss uses Favor), everyone should stack tightly at mid (A) with the MT
  - No cleaves in this phase. Prioritise clear positioning and resolving mechs
