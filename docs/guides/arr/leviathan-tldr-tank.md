Throughout the fight, the boss will disappear and use 1-2 Spinning Dives, then reappear with Body Slam. These are telegraphed by water jets:\

- Spinning Dive: Does high damage with a vuln stack, and can knock you off the arena
- Body Slam: Tilts the arena, which can make you slide off. Dodge to the opposite end of the arena

## Phase 1

The boss has a head that reflects ranged physical damage, and a tail that reflects magic damage. MT grabs the head while OT grabs the tail.

- Dread Tide: Line attack used by the head. MT should always stay in the corner beside the head to point this outside the arena

2 Wavespine Sahagin will spawn, which OT should grab.

Then, a Wavetooth Sahagin will spawn, which OT should again grab. It must be burnt asap as it has 2 hysteria attacks. OT should stun it the moment it drops below 80% HP. At <70% HP, it will immediately start casting Dreadstorm, during which it is immune to stun.

Later, 4 Gyre Spumes will spawn. Keep 1 Gyre alive until the boss disappears to start 2 dives, then kill it.

The boss will reappear briefly, then disappear again for 1 vertical dive. Press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 2

Another 2 Wavespines will spawn.

Then, another 4 Gyres will spawn, followed by 4 Wave Spumes (shown above). OT should grab the Wave Spumes, but don't bother trying to kill them. After the next Slam, kite them to the corner furthest from the party and pop invuln. They will explode and deal proximity-based damage.

After the Wave Spumes have exploded, the boss will again disappear for 1 vertical dive. Similarly, press the converter quickly to survive Tidal Wave.

## Phase 3

Another Wavetooth will spawn. Remember to stun and burn it asap. It can easily hysteria everyone off the arena.
