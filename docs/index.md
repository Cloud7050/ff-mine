This site holds some of my detailed FFXIV guides for running old, high-end content at Minimum Item level, No Echo (MINE) - duty settings which make them harder.

MINE content has a niche audience. Some of the wikis/videos/other guides out there may be brief, outdated, or even inaccurate since the content is so old. This is a step towards improving that.

These guides compile my findings from having run and tested the content. Hopefully they're useful enough to teach you how to clear the fights too.
